   abstract = {Listeners quickly adapt to novel accents. There are three main hypotheses for how they do so. Some suggest that listeners expand their phonetic categories, allowing more variability in how a sound is pronounced. Others argue that listeners shift their categories instead, only accepting deviations consistent with the accent. A third hypothesis is that listeners both shift and expand their categories. Most work has supported the category expansion hypotheses, with the key exception of Maye et al. (2008) who argued for a shifting strategy. Here, we apply the ideal adaptor model from Kleinschmidt & Jaeger (2015) to reexamine what conclusions can be drawn from their data. We compare adaptation models in which categories are shifted, expanded, or both shifted and expanded. We show that models involving expansion can explain the data as well as, if not better than, the shift model, in contrast to what has been previously concluded from these data.},

   abstract = {We welcome the proposal to use forward models to understand predictive processes in language processing. However, Pickering & Garrod (P&G) miss the opportunity to provide a strong framework for future work. Forward models need to be pursued in the context of learning. This naturally leads to questions about what prediction error these models aim to minimize.},

@article{kleinschmidt-jaeger2015,
   abstract = {Successful speech perception requires that listeners map the acoustic signal to linguistic categories. These mappings are not only probabilistic, but change depending on the situation. For example, one talker's /p/ might be physically indistinguishable from another talker's /b/ (cf. lack of invariance). We characterize the computational problem posed by such a subjectively nonstationary world and propose that the speech perception system overcomes this challenge by (a) recognizing previously encountered situations, (b) generalizing to other situations based on previous similar experience, and (c) adapting to novel situations. We formalize this proposal in the ideal adapter framework: (a) to (c) can be understood as inference under uncertainty about the appropriate generative model for the current talker, thereby facilitating robust speech perception despite the lack of invariance. We focus on 2 critical aspects of the ideal adapter. First, in situations that clearly deviate from previous experience, listeners need to adapt. We develop a distributional (belief-updating) learning model of incremental adaptation. The model provides a good fit against known and novel phonetic adaptation data, including perceptual recalibration and selective adaptation. Second, robust speech recognition requires that listeners learn to represent the structured component of cross-situation variability in the speech signal. We discuss how these 2 aspects of the ideal adapter provide a unifying explanation for adaptation, talker-specificity, and generalization across talkers and groups of talkers (e.g., accents and dialects). The ideal adapter provides a guiding framework for future investigations into speech perception and adaptation, and more broadly language comprehension.},
