# Stop: Do not implement beyond this point

# To do after Phase 9
+ think about whether evaluate_model should be renamed. it's job is similar to the add information criteria (IC) functions in brms, just that it's frequentist log-likelihood or accuracy vs. Bayesian ICs. perhaps this could be unified by changing the evaluate_models function into several separate add_* functions that add the IC to the model (similar to brms), allowing also a common compare models function that would extend that compare_models function from non-stanfit to stanfit model (allowing comparison on any IC)?

+ also check whether evaluate_model applied to stanfit or stanfit posterior objects , which currently uses method = "loglik", makes sense 



### Stan-related

+ temporarily change stan programs to echo inputs so that the correct structure of inputs can get verified. at that point revisit for broad range of inputs (1d-3d, nix/mnix/niw, w/ or w/o zero exposure) whether a simpler alternative to to_array can be found.

+ Ultimately, we need tests that generate test responses based on posterior (post-exposure) NIX/MNIX/NIW beliefs that were obtained by updating prior (pre-exposure) NIX/MNIX/NIW beliefs with the exposure data. That will let us check whether the 'forward updating' and the inferences of the prior beliefs are aligned---i.e., whether we can recover the prior beliefs provided there are sufficiently information exposure-test combinations in the data used to fit the stanfit model.
