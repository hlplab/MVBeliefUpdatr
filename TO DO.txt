IMPORTANT

+ make plot that checks assumptions of NIW updating: category distribution and covariance across talkers.

+ then figure out to add information about input to that new class
++ add exposure mean in more accessible format. Update get_exposure_mean to read in that mean
++ add exposure covariance (not uncentered squares) in accessible format. Updated get_expsoure_covariance to read in the information
+++ test whether plot_expected_categories_2D works with plot.exposure = T after those two steps.
++ add information about groups and categories (number and order of levels)
+++ update get_category_levels(), get_group_level(), and get_original_levels().
+++ Test that everything still works


EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS
+ it should be possible to speed up marginalizing a LOT if prior is uniform. even if it isn't one might be able to derive the analytic form , rather than to sum by row.


CATCH UP
+ implement tests for NIW functions


LESS IMPORTANT
+ change "IBBU" parameters to "NIW" through documentation.
+ make plot of NIW_belief parameters (standard plotting function)
+ make NIW_belief and NIW_beliefs classes? think about how they should be related.

+ Rename variable names in .stan program to appropriately use M_0 and M_n (rather than mu_0 and mu_n) as well as S_0 and S_n (rather than sigma_0 and sigma_n). Then change add_ibbu_draws() function to refer to those parameters. This will reduce confusion. ADD_IBBU_DRAWS HAS BEEN UPDATED TO *RETURN* Ms AND Ss, BUT THE .STAN PROGRAM HAS NOT YET BEEN CHANGED AND ADD_IBBU_DRAWS STILL EXPECTS THE *INPUT* TO BE MU AND SIGMA.








DONE:

+ figure out how to make class so that the new class is ADDED to stanfit class and inherits from it.
+ Implement class for mv_ibbu stanfits. See class.R
++ Test that add_ibbu_draws still works on the new object class.
++ Test that plotting functions still work on the new object class.


EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS
+ consider reworking add_ibbu_draws following part that gets non-nested samples. consider using that to THEN nest those samples. might be faster and less code + more transparent?
