IMPORTANT

+ GENERAL
++ consider making NIW_MCMC and NIW_belief one class. or at least the former is a subclass of the latter?
++ make NIW_belief and NIW_beliefs classes? think about how they should be related.

++ add ability to add noise to data (new variables cues_noisy) independent of the update function.
+++ update get_category_levels(), get_group_level(), and get_original_levels().


+ NIW_BELIEF RELATED FUNCTIONS
++ expand update_beliefs to handle multiple exposure groups.


+ IBBU_STANFIT RELATED FUNCTIONS
++ make function that take stanfit as input and extracts prior in NIW_belief format.


+ MAKE NEW IO FUNCTIONS AND KEEP THEM GENERAL ENOUGH TO USE THEM IN MORE COMPLEX FUNCTIONS
++ consider using dave's cross-validating functions. Talk with xin about how to best do that.
++ make a function plot_category() that does all the plotting of the category. only keep the stuff about getting expected category in the original plot_expected_category, and add options to plot mode, instead of mean, and to take ***samples*** from the distribution. using a function that allows sampling from NIW will be important.
++ include a function that can categorize data from one group on beliefs of other group.
++ add plots for category means and (log) SDs and correlations in more accessible format. Update get_exposure_mean to read in that mean
++ add exposure covariance (not uncentered squares) in accessible format. Updated get_expsoure_covariance to read in the information



+ NIW_BELIEF RELATED PLOTTING
++ make plot that checks assumptions of NIW updating: category distribution and covariance across talkers.
++ make plot visualizing m and S for univariate, bivariate, and trivariate (see Murphy 2012, p. 127). add to the description that samples of category can be obtain by a variant of plot_expected_category. (see next point)
++ make plot of NIW_belief parameters (standard plotting function)


+ NIW_IBBU_STANFIT RELATED PLOTTING
++++ add "more X-like" "more y-like" to x-axis of test_categorization plots





EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS
+ it should be possible to speed up marginalizing a LOT if prior is uniform. even if it isn't one might be able to derive the analytic form , rather than to sum by row.


CATCH UP
+ implement tests for NIW functions











DONE:
+++ test whether plot_expected_categories_2D works with plot.exposure = T after those two steps.
++ add information about groups and categories (number and order of levels)
+ then figure out to add information about input to that new class
+ Rename variable names in .stan program to appropriately use M_0 and M_n (rather than mu_0 and mu_n) as well as S_0 and S_n (rather than sigma_0 and sigma_n). Then change add_ibbu_draws() function to refer to those parameters. This will reduce confusion. ADD_IBBU_DRAWS HAS BEEN UPDATED TO *RETURN* Ms AND Ss, BUT THE .STAN PROGRAM HAS NOT YET BEEN CHANGED AND ADD_IBBU_DRAWS STILL EXPECTS THE *INPUT* TO BE MU AND SIGMA.
+ change plot_expected_categorization to show the category label in the legend (instead of category id.)
+ figure out how to make class so that the new class is ADDED to stanfit class and inherits from it.
+ Implement class for mv_ibbu stanfits. See class.R
++ Test that add_ibbu_draws still works on the new object class.
++ Test that plotting functions still work on the new object class.


EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS
+ consider reworking add_ibbu_draws following part that gets non-nested samples. consider using that to THEN nest those samples. might be faster and less code + more transparent?
