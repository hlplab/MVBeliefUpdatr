# MVBeliefUpdatr

While this library is not public, you *can't* yet install it via devtools::install_github. Please clone the repository and then use:

```
devtools::install("path_to_the_cloned_folder")
```

That should install MVBeliefUpdatr and all of its dependencies. If some dependencies are *not* automatically installed, please let me 
(Florian) know, so that I can add them to the dependencies. 

# Reporting bugs

As a member of the HLP lab group, you can also comment on this library, open issues (click Issues tab above), or change the code and 
initiate a pull request (either through the web interface) or by using RStudio. To use RStudio, simply open the project with the 
cloned repository on your computer, go to the Git tab (usually one of the panels in the top right corner). Click "New Branch", choose
a name for the new branch (e.g., "xinxie-fix-1" or "burchill-plotting-patch"; you don't have to select the remote or any other option
--- just stick with the defaults). Switch to that branch if it didn't happen automatically 
(by clicking on the pull down menu right next to the "New Branch" button; it usually says "master", but not should say the name of your
new branch). Then edit the code the way you think is best (don't worry, you're not destroying anything). Then press push.

Your help is much appreciated.
