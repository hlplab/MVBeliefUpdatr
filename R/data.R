#' Chodroff & Wilson (2018) data on word-initial stop-voicing in native US English
#'
#' A subset of the data collected and annotated by Chodroff & Wilson (2018) of word-initial stop-voicing in native US English.
#' Six stop categories ("b", "p", "d", "t", "g", "k") were recorded in two types of tasks that are known to elicit different
#' speech styles: connected speech with faster speech rates, and isolated word productions with slower speech rates. The data
#' contain annotations for three phonetic cues to stop-voicing: voice onset time (VOT), f0 (in either Hz or semitones), and
#' vowel duration. For details, please see Chodroff & Wilson (2018), which should be cited if these data are used.
#'
#' Note that the present data are a \emph{subset} of the data collected by Chodroff & Wilson (2018), and are not cleaned for issues
#' like pitch doubling or halving. The full data are available on Eleanor Chodroff's OSF repo at \url{https://osf.io/jt5mc/}.
