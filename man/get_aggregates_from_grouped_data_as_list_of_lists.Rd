\usage{
get_aggregates_from_grouped_data_as_list_of_lists(
  data,
  groups,
  cols,
  fill = as.list(rep(NA, length(list(...)))),
  verbose = F,

\arguments{
\item{data}{`tibble` or `data.frame` with the data.}

\item{groups}{Character vector of column names that contain information about which observations form a group.
These columns must factors.}

\item{cols}{Character vector of column names for which aggregate values should be obtained. This can be more than
one column, but only one aggregate will be returned \emph{across} columns, i.e., the aggregate will be calculated for
each unique group in the data.}

\item{fill}{What value should be substituted for `groups` for which there is no data (see `...`)? (default: `NA`)}

\item{...}{A named list of aggregating functions of `cols` to calculate for each unique combination of grouping
variables `groups` in `data`.}
}
\value{
A named list of length `...` (names are the names of the functions that have been computed). The list will
  be sorted by the `group` variables (in the order they are presented), in ascending order of the levels of those
  variables. The elements of the list will be lists.
  Missing values---resulting from combinations of grouping variables for which there is no data---will be filled
  with the value provided in `fill` and coerced into the same structure as all other outputs for that function
  (e.g., if the function f results in a 2-element vector for all combinations of `groups` variables for which
  there is data, then unobserved data results in a 2-element vector of `fill` values).
}
\description{
Get aggregates from grouped data for any number aggregation functions specified in `...`. The columns specified in
`cols` jointly (essentially as a matrix) form the input to the aggregation functions. Aggregates are obtained
separately for each unique combinations values for the variables specified in the grouping variables `groups`
(which must be factors). For combinations of the grouping variables for which there is no data, the value in
`fill` will be substituted, repeated up to the necessary dimensionality (inferred from the other outputs of
the aggregation function).
